debian/control is semi-generated from the script ./debian/mkcontrol.
This is done by running:

  ./debian/rules update-control

It will also generate / update most of the per-language debian/* config
files, except the postinst and prerm scripts, which you'll have to
manually upgrade.

FIXME: fix mkcontrol and debian/rules to work with the en_AU sound file
set.
